This is a very minimal authenticator allowing a set of usernames and hashed passwords to be provided for JupyterHub. 

A toml file called `logins.toml` should be placed at `/etc/jupyterhub/logins.toml` on the server.

The usernames and passwords in `logins_example.toml` are:

  **admin : password**

  **user : userpass**

You should change them!!
